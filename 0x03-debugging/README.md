## Debugging

1. 0-main.c, main.h - Test that the func 'positive_or_negative()' gives the correct output when given a case of '0'.
2. 1-main.c - Comment out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
3. 2-largest_number.c, main.c - Fix the code in '2-largest_number.c' so that it correctly prints out the largest of the three numbers no matter the case.
4. 3-print_remaing_days.c, main.c - Fix the 'print_remaining_days()' func so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
