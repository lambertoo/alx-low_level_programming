#### First day of C programming
	 C is a powerful and foundational programming language with immense importance in the world of software engineering. Here are a few reasons why C is crucial:

    *Efficiency: C allows you to write highly efficient code, making it ideal for system-level programming and developing resource-intensive applications.

    *Portability: C code can be easily ported to different platforms, making it suitable for creating software that can run on various devices and operating systems.

    *Foundation for other languages: Many modern programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python, have roots in C. Learning C will provide you with a solid foundation and make it easier to grasp these languages.

    *Widely used: C is extensively used in industries such as embedded systems, operating systems, game development, and networking. Mastering C opens up diverse career opportunities and allows you to work on cutting-edge technologies.

    *Low-level control: C gives you direct access to memory and hardware resources, allowing you to have fine-grained control over your programs. This is crucial when performance optimization is paramount.

#### 0x02-functions_nested_loops
* Allowed editors: 'vi', 'vim', 'emacs'
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using 'gcc', using the options '-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89'
* All your files should end with a new line
* A 'README.md' file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the 'Betty' style. It will be checked using 'betty-style.pl' and 'betty-doc.pl'
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like 'printf', 'puts', etc… is forbidden
* You are allowed to use '_putchar'
* You don’t have to push '_putchar.c', we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
* In the following examples, the 'main.c' files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own 'main.c' files at compilation. Our 'main.c' files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function '_putchar' should be included in your header file called 'main.h'
* Don’t forget to push your header file

#### 0x03-debugging
* Allowed editors: 'vi', 'vim', 'emacs'
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using 'gcc', using the options '-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89'
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your code should use the 'Betty' style. It will be checked using 'betty-style.pl' and 'betty-doc.pl'
* A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. '0x03-debugging'), describing what this project is about

#### 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops

* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the 'gcc' flags '-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89'
* What are header files and how to to use them with '#include'

#### 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
* What are pointers and how to use them
